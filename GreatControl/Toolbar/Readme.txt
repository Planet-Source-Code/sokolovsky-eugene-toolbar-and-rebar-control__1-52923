About the vbAccelerator CoolMenu Toolbar and Rebar Control
----------------------------------------------------------
This control provides an all VB replacement for the toolbar and rebar 
controls in COMCTL32.OCX/COMCT332.OCX.  It provides all the features 
required to implement IE4/IE5 style toolbars including the CoolMenu
support.

Some of the great features of this implementation are:
1) Toolbars
-----------
a) CoolMenu support in toolbars.
b) Swap between List Style and Standard toolbar at runtime.
c) Hide text for all or selected buttons.
d) Toolbars support hot and disabled image lists as well as the standard
   type.  This allows you to set up different images to display when the
   mouse is over a button.
e) Toolbar buttons can autosize to fit the supplied text.
f) Dropdown toolbar buttons are fully supported.
g) Toolbar Buttons can be made invisible.
h) Smoother and more efficient methods to enable, change image and press
   buttons that the VB implementation.
i) Provides access to the default system image lists.  Get all the 
   standard toolbar button images for free!

2) Rebars
---------
a) Allows any type of control to be hosted
b) Chevron support - if the rebar band is too narrow, a chevron will appear
c) Rebar bands can be hidden (provided you have COMMCTRL.DLL v4.71 or above)
d) A background bitmap can be shown behind the control.  Toolbars added
   to the Rebar are transparent and the bitmap shows through.
e) Specify minimum band widths in the rebar
f) Automatically mimimise the arrangement of bands to fit a specified 
   area.
